# DMQB 2017 team GREEN

DMQB 2017 Team Green data repository.

## What is this repo about?
You can put your whole projects related stuff in here. I suggest that you have a little structure like:

    repo.git
      |
      |------ docs
      |------ src
      |------ data
      ...
      README.md
      LICENSE
      
or similar, to keep you content organized. But be free to create an own structure :)
